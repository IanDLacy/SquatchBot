#### Context Explained For Jimmy :
#
# I've detected a command because the message
# content started with './'.
#
# I parse it and call your function, in this case
# it's called 'ping'.
#
# Before calling it, I package up some information
# about the message and current state of things.
#
# I give it to you when I call your function by
# passing it as the first argument.
